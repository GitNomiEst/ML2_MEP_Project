# Welcome to my project!

## Spec's (stable funtioning application)
- OS: running on Windows 11 Home
- Processor / RAM: Intel Core i7-1185G7, 16 GB RAM
- IDE used: Visual Studio Code (VSC) > developed by Microsoft

## Instructions
Start app: flask run
App starts on: http://localhost:5000/

Before running the code it is neccessariy to create a virtual Environment and install the requirements I added in requirements.txt.
Then add the MongoDB Credentials No√©mie provided you in model.py & api.py (within the string: mongodb+srv://kaeseno1:<password>@cluster0.4pnoho7.mongodb.net/)

## Supporting commands
Update requirements: pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Access to MongoDB & API Key
Mongo DB access: please get in touch with kaeseno1@students.zhaw.ch to get the password (required in model.py & api.py). Please do not share this secret with anyone else.
API Key: please generate your own API key if you want to load more data into the mongo DB. But this is not neccessarily required for running the code.

## Questions?
https://letmegoogleforyou.com/ ... no, just joking, I hope that I added enough comments so the code is understandable and working for you. Otherwise, I might help you; just write a mail to kaeseno1@students.zhaw.ch
